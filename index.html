<h3>AIR QUALITY INDEX</h3>
<br>
<div style ="background-color:PowderBlue;display:inline-block">
<p style="color:Brown;font-size:35px">
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized index used to communicate the level of air quality to the public. It provides information about the quality of air in a specific location and its potential impact on health. The AQI is typically calculated based on the concentrations of several common air pollutants, including:
<br>
Ground-level ozone (O3)<br>
Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)<br>
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)<br>
Sulfur dioxide (SO2)<br>
Carbon monoxide (CO)<br>
The concentrations of these pollutants are measured and converted into a numerical index that represents the overall air quality. The AQI is divided into categories that indicate different levels of health concern, ranging from "Good" to "Hazardous." These categories help the public understand the potential health risks associated with the current air quality.</p></div>

<h4>CAUSES</h4>
<p style="color:YellowGreen;font-size:35px">
<b><u>Burning of Fossil Fuels</b></u><br><br>
The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.<br>

<b><u>Automobiles</b></u><br><br>
The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals.<br>

<b><u>Agricultural Activities</b></u><br><br>
Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The insecticides, pesticides and fertilisers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and contaminate it.<br>

<b><u>Factories and Industries</b></u><br><br>
Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released into the air, degrading its quality.<br>

<b><u>Mining Activities</b></u><br><br>
In the mining process, the minerals below the earth are extracted using large pieces of equipment. The dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air, but also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas.<br>

<b><u>Domestic Sources</b></u><br><br>
The household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released in the air. The smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the paints. It not only pollutes the air but also affects breathing.</p>

<h5  style="color:PowderBlue;font-size:30px"><b>EVERY SILHOUTTE HAS BLURRED<br>EVERY  BLINK PAINFUL<br>EVERY  BREATH TOXIC</b><br><br></h5>
<h5 style="color:Green;font-size:30px">The dereliction of  duties  of the forest  deartment and other administrations has led to the rise in the AQI and has tranformed the  cities into a <u>GAS CHAMBER</u><br></h5>
<h4>HAZARDOUS EFFECTS</h4>
<h5  style="color:Green;font-size:30px">
<div style ="background-color:PowderBlue;display:inline-block">
Air pollution can affect lung development and is implicated in the development of emphysema, asthma, and other respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<br><br>

Increases in asthma prevalence and severity are linked to urbanization and outdoor air pollution. Children living in low-income urban areas tend to have more asthma cases than others. Research published in 2023 tied two air pollutants, ozone and PM2.5, to asthma-related changes in children’s airways.
PM and nitrogen oxide are linked to chronic bronchitis.
<br><br>
In 2020, a major public health challenge was confluence of the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires across the western U.S. Building on a well-established connection between air pollution and respiratory-tract infections, a study linked wildfire smoke with additional COVID-19 cases and deaths.</div><br><br><br>

<div style ="background-color:PaleGreen;display:inline-block">
Higher air pollution levels increase short-term respiratory infections, which lead to more school absences.<br><br>
Children who play several outdoor sports and live in high ozone communities are more likely to develop asthma.<br><br>
Children living near busy roads are at increased risk for asthma.<br><br>
Children with asthma who were exposed to high levels of air pollutants were more likely to develop bronchitis symptoms.<br><br>
Living in communities with higher pollution levels can cause lung damage</div><br><br><br><br></div>

<div style ="background-color:LightYellow;display:inline-block">
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a public health challenge for aging populations. NIEHS-funded researchers at the University of Washington identified a link between air pollution and dementias. This well-conducted study adds considerable evidence that ambient air fine particles increase risk of dementias. Conversely, a multi-year study published in 2022 shows improved air quality is associated with lower risk of dementia in older women. The researchers also stated this decline in dementia risk was equivalent to taking nearly 2 1/2 years off the age of the women studied.<br><br>
Air pollution was linked to a greater chance of developing several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias. Hospital admissions data from 63 million older adults in the U.S., obtained over 17 years (2000-2016), was analyzed along with estimated PM 2.5 concentrations by zip code to conduct the study.<br><br>
In older adults, long-term exposure to TRAP may significantly hasten physical disabilities. The risk is more pronounced among racial minorities and lower-income people.<br><br>
Osteoporosis affects women more than men. A large study associated high levels of air pollutants with bone damage, particularly in the lumbar spine, among postmenopausal women.<br><br>
 This study expands previous findings linking air pollution and bone damage.</div></h5><br>
